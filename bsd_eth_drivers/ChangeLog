	- added ChangeLog
	- moved arp_ifinit from libbsdport.h to libbsdport_post.h
	- replaced inport_xxx/outport_xxx by in_xxx/out_xxx and _IO_BASE
	- bookE has not mftb instruction :-( we must use mfspr
	  (but that wouldn't work on classic ppc if we were not
	  in supervisory mode).
	- type adaptions in libbsdport.h to protect us against
	  alias rule and to silence warnings.
